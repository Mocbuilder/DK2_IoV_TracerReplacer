# DK2 IoV TracerReplacer
There is a bug in the popular IoV mod for Door Kickers 2, which has been there for over a year and a half now. If you encounter any error related to "Tracer_Rifle_Gr_IoV" than this will fix it.
Needs to be run every time you update the mod or replace its files in general.
It replaces the TracerTemplate "Rifle_Tracer_Gr_IoV" which is from the IoV mod, with the native "Rifle_Tracer", which doesnt cause an error.

I am in no way affiliated with either the DK2 team or the IoV Mod Team. Credit goes to them for their game and mod , respectivly.
